## 0. Purpose (Non-negotiable)
This document provides an auditable mapping:
- **REQ (requirements.md)** → **Contract (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI)** → **Design components** → **Implementation tasks**
Used for:
- Coverage checks (no missing REQs)
- Drift checks (no unscoped operations/components)
- Review gating

Sources of truth:
- requirements: `10_prd/requirements.md`
- OpenAPI: `30_contract/openapi.yaml`
- AsyncAPI: `30_contract/asyncapi.yaml`
- Architecture: `40_design/architecture.md`
- Design: `40_design/design.md`
- Decisions: `40_design/decisions.md`
- Tasks: `40_design/tasks.md`

---

## 1. Rules (Do not violate)
1. Every row MUST include a **REQ-ID**.
2. Each row MUST include at least one of:
   - **operationId** (HTTP), OR
   - **messageId** (Event)
3. Contract mappings MUST be consistent with:
   - OpenAPI `x-requirements`
   - AsyncAPI `x-requirements`
4. "Component" MUST be a stable name used in design documents.
5. "TASK-ID" MUST exist in tasks.md once design phase starts.
6. If a REQ is intentionally not mapped, mark it explicitly as:
   - `CoverageStatus = N/A` with a reason in Notes (rare, but allowed)

---

## 2. Status Definitions
### 2.1 CoverageStatus
- **Planned**: mapping exists, not implemented yet
- **InProgress**: implementation ongoing
- **Done**: implemented and verified against acceptance criterion
- **Deferred**: intentionally postponed (must have reason)
- **N/A**: not applicable for this feature scope (must have reason)

### 2.2 Verification
- **Unit**: unit tests cover acceptance
- **Integration**: integration tests cover acceptance
- **E2E**: end-to-end tests cover acceptance
- **Manual**: manual verification only (discouraged; must justify)
- **None**: not verified yet

---

## 3. Traceability Matrix (REQ -> Contract -> Design -> Tasks)

> Notes:
> - Use **one row per REQ** as the default.
> - If a single REQ maps to multiple operations/events, either:
>   - list multiple IDs in the same cell (comma-separated), OR
>   - split into multiple rows with the same REQ-ID and different Contract IDs (choose one style and stick to it).
> - Avoid "TBD" in review phase. Use it only in early phases.

| REQ-ID | operationId (HTTP) | messageId (Event) | Components | TASK-IDs | CoverageStatus | Verification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-ID | N/A | N/A | TBD | N/A | Planned | None | - |
| REQ-0001 | N/A | N/A | TBD | TASK-0001 | Done | None | - |
| REQ-0002 | createTask, getTask, updateTask, deleteTask | N/A | TBD | TASK-0002, TASK-0003 | Done | None | - |
| REQ-0003 | getTaskHierarchy | N/A | TBD | TASK-0002, TASK-0004 | Planned | None | - |
| REQ-0004 | listTasks, getTaskHierarchy | N/A | TBD | TASK-0009, TASK-0010 | Planned | None | - |
| REQ-0005 | listTasks, searchTasks, listTags, createTag, updateTag, deleteTag | N/A | TBD | TASK-0005, TASK-0006 | Planned | None | - |
| REQ-0006 | getTaskQueue, addTaskToQueue, removeTaskFromQueue, clearTaskQueue | N/A | TBD | TASK-0002, TASK-0007 | Planned | None | - |
| REQ-0007 | getTaskQueue | N/A | TBD | TASK-0009, TASK-0011 | Planned | None | - |

## 4. Contract Drift Checks (Must be empty at Review)
> ここが埋まっている限り、レビューで「判定OK」は出せない。

### 4.1 HTTP operations without REQ mapping
(None - all operations mapped)

### 4.2 Event messages without REQ mapping
(None - all messages mapped)

### 4.3 Design components without REQ mapping
(Manual check required - components extracted from design.md)

---

## 5. Coverage Summary (Optional but recommended)
- Total REQs: 8
- Mapped to HTTP: 6
- Mapped to Events: 0
- Done: 2
- InProgress: 0
- Planned: 6
- Deferred/N/A: 0
